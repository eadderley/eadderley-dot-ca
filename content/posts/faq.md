# Contact
1. Why don't you have any contact information provided?

If you need to reach me, you already know how. I'm not currently looking for a job, I'm not terribly important, and I'm not on-call anymore. Win.

# Website Stuff

1. Why'd you build this site?

Well, I figured I'd eventually need someplace to showcase my skills. Why not do it with a serverless, CICD website that I update through git? If anyone wants to dig, all the information that they could want is here, one way or another.  

2. _How'd_ you build this site?

Like the footer says, with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Which I cotton'd on to from reading my friend [Vince's](https://vince.ca/) site. The idea of a markdown-powered site appealed to me, a humble systems engineered, bereft of any real skill with CSS and taste besides. Then halfway through reading the docs, I stumbled upon a tutorial for integrating Hugo with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and my brain started churning. The whole build process is detailed [here]({{< ref "/posts/build" >}} "lol doesnt exist"), if you're actually interested.
